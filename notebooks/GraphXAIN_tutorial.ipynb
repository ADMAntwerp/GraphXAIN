    "    1) Start the explanation immediately.\n",

    "    3) Only mention the top {num_feat} most important features in the narrative.\n",

    "\n",
    "    **Content related rules**:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1) Be clear about what the model actually predicted for the target node with index {node_index}.\n",
    "    2) Discuss how the features and/or nodes contributed to final prediction. Make sure to clearly establish this the first time you refer to a feature or node. \n",
    "    3) Discuss how the subgraph's edge importance contribute to final prediction. Make sure to clearly establish this the first time you refer to an edge connection.\n",
    "    4) Consider the feature importance, feature values, averages, and percentiles when referencing their relative importance.\n",
    "    5) Begin the discussion of features by presenting those with the highest feature importance values first. The reader should be able to tell what the order of importance of the features is based on their feature importance value.\n",
    "    6) Provide a suggestion or interpretation as to why a feature contributed in a certain direction. Try to introduce external knowledge that you might have.\n",
    "    7) If there is no simple explanation for the effect of a feature, consider the context of other features and/or nodes in the interpretation.\n",
    "    8) Do not use the feature importance numeric values in your answer.\n",
    "    9) You can use the feature values themselves in the explanation, as long as they are not categorical variables.\n",
    "    10) Do not refer to the average and/or percentile for every single feature; reserve it for features where it truly clarifies the explanation.\n",
    "    11) When discussing a node's categorical data, make sure to indicate whether the presence (1) or absence (0) of a feature is contextually informative and/or significantly contributes to the explanation. State that it is one of the posibble values among that category.\n",
    "    12) When discussing the connections between the nodes, relate how the influence of a node's relationship might impact final prediction.\n",
    "    13) When you refer to node and edges, keep in mind that the target node is a {node_description} and edges are {edges_description} in this dataset.\n",
    "    14) Tell a clear and engaging story, including details from both feature values and node connections, to make the explanation more relatable and interesting.\n",
