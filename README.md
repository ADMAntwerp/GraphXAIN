# GraphXAIN: Narratives to Explain Graph Neural Networks

This repository contains the official implementation for the article **GraphXAIN: Narratives to Explain Graph Neural Networks** (Cedro & Martens, 2024). Our method integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), graph explainers, and Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate GraphXAINs, explainable AI (XAI) narratives that enhance the interpretability of GNN predictions.

## Abstract

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are a powerful technique for machine learning on graph-structured data, yet they pose challenges in interpretability. Existing GNN explanation methods usually yield technical outputs, such as subgraphs and feature importance scores, that are difficult for non-data scientists to understand and thereby violate the purpose of explanations. Motivated by recent Explainable AI (XAI) research, we propose *GraphXAIN*, a method that generates natural language narratives explaining GNN predictions. GraphXAIN is a model- and explainer-agnostic method that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to translate explanatory subgraphs and feature importance scores into coherent, story-like explanations of GNN decision-making processes. Evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate GraphXAIN's ability to improve graph explanations. A survey of machine learning researchers and practitioners reveals that GraphXAIN enhances four explainability dimensions: understandability, satisfaction, convincingness, and suitability for communicating model predictions. When combined with another graph explainer method, GraphXAIN further improves trustworthiness, insightfulness, confidence, and usability. Notably, 95% of participants found GraphXAIN to be a valuable addition to the GNN explanation method. By incorporating natural language narratives, our approach serves both graph practitioners and non-expert users by providing clearer and more effective explanations.

## Usage

To generate GraphXAINs for a given GNN model:

1. **Prepare Data**: Ensure you have ready-to-use graph data or adjacency matrix with features matrix ready for the input graph.
2. **Train GNN Model**: Train your GNN model.
3. **Run the Graph Explainer**: Follow the ```notebooks/GraphXAIN_tutorial.ipynb``` notebook to extract subgraphs and feature importance values.
4. **Generate GraphXAINs**:  Follow the ```notebooks/GraphXAIN_tutorial.ipynb``` notebook to generate GraphXAINs based on the extracted data.

## Required Changes in PyTorch Geometric

To successfully run the code in this repository, **you must modify** certain functions in PyTorch Geometric. We have provided a file, `pyg_modifications.py`, which contains **all** the updated functions needed.

1. **Open our `pyg_modifications.py`**  
   - This file is in the root of this repo (or wherever you placed it).
   - Inside, youâ€™ll find code blocks for each function that needs patching:
     - `Explanation.visualize_graph`
     - `HeteroExplanation.visualize_feature_importance`
     - `_visualize_score`
     - `_visualize_graph_via_graphviz`

2. **Copy each code block** into PyTorch Geometric  
   - For example, copy the `visualize_graph` block into:
     ```
     torch_geometric/explain/explanation.py
     ```
     within the `Explanation` class.
   - Similarly, copy the `visualize_feature_importance` block into the `HeteroExplanation` class in the same file.
   - Copy the `_visualize_score` function wherever it is declared in that file (either replacing the existing one or adding it if missing).
   - Lastly, copy the `_visualize_graph_via_graphviz` block into:
     ```
     torch_geometric/visualization/graph.py
     ```
     replacing the existing function if present.

**Note:** Please ensure you run notebooks from the **root directory** of this repository. This guarantees that the file paths and environment references will resolve correctly.
